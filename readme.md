# tiduna,xalAn
This repository contains resources and stuff for the tiduna,xalAn conlang; a submission for Agma Schwa's second Cursed Conlang Circus.

Here you will find:
- language.ods: Spreadsheet containing phonology, grammar, and word list. (this can be opened with LibreOffice Calc, or if you don't have that, you could also import it into Google Sheets)
- translations.txt: A few translations I did, including the bee movie text.
- phoneticize.jar: Simple program to convert a given tiduna,xalAn phrase into IPA. Takes one or more phrases as commandline arguments (phrases should be passed in as a single string; you should quote them in your shell).
