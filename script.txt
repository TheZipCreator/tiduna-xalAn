The script of tiduna,xalAn is sort of an abugida; vowels are put below their consonant. If there is no consonant before a given vowel, it is just put in the consonant's place.
The horizontal direction (Y in Goxel) specifies a single descriptor.
The vertical direction (Z in Goxel) is every descriptor in a given word.
The direction orthogonal to those two (X in Goxel) represents individual words.
The script has no punctuation; instead you insert a space at the end of a sentence.
